# MriBaseApp

Using the MriBaseApp allows users to conduct some of the tests of the [Clever Dog Lab](https://www.vetmeduni.ac.at/en/cognition/clever-dog-lab) at home using their own touchscreen device. These tests are designed to challenge the mental capabilities of the participating dogs and provide a fun training experience for them.

## Installation

The app can be installed on Android devices using the apk file provided in the [latest release](/releases/latest). Download the file directly on your Android device or download it to your computer and transfer it to the device.

The app has been designed for tablets. These have a large enough touchscreen size for dogs to interact with.

## Trainings

Multiple kinds of trainings are available in the app. These trainings range in difficulty from beginner friendly to challenging.

### Entire Touchscreen

This training can be used to get the dog accustomed to interacting with the touchscreen device. The entire screen displays a single color. The dog is now supposed to touch any part of the screen. One the screen is touched the color disappears and a short sound is played. The dog should now be rewarded for correctly interacting with the touchscreen. After a short delay the color returns and the dog can again interact with it.

### One Image

In this training a single image is displayed in the middle of the touchscreen. With this training the dog will learn that only specific parts of the screen can be interacted with. Touching any part of the screen that is not the displayed image will lead to no reaction. Once the image in the middle of the screen is touched the reward sound will play and the dog should be rewarded.

### Random Position

An image is displayed at a random position on the touchscreen. The dog is instructed to touch the image to be rewarded. Once the image is touched it will disappear for a short time while the reward sound is played. Afterwards the image will reappear at a new random location.

### Two Images

Two images, one circle and one square, are displayed on the touchscreen. The dog is supposed to touch the image of the square. When the correct image is touched the reward sound is played and the dog should be rewarded. If the incorrect image is touched instead a different sound will play. In both cases the images will disappear for a short duration. If the incorrect image was pressed the same images will reappear at the same positions as the previous trial. This repeat until the correct image is pressed and a new trial with different images on random positions will appear.

### Several Images

Six images are displayed on the screen. One image is a Square while the remaining five are circles. The square must be pressed in order for the dog to be rewarded. Pressing a circle will result in a negative sound and no reward should be given.

### Go-NoGo

A single image is displayed in the middle of the screen. The image is eighter a square or a circle. 

If a square is displayed the dog must touch the image. After a successful touch the dog should be rewarded. If the dog does not press the square withing a specified timeframe the image will disappear, and a negative sound will be played. After a short time, the same image will reappear to give the dog another chance to press it.

If a circle is displayed the dog should not touch the image. The image should not be interacted with for a specified time frame after which the reward sound is played, and the dog should be rewarded. If the dog does press the circle the negative sound is played, and the image disappears for a short time. Once the image reappears the dog can reattempt this trial.

### Matching To Sample

At first a singular image is displayed in the middle of the screen. This image cannot be interacted with. Even if the dog presses on the image nothing will occur. After a short time, the image will disappear and two images will be displayed on the left and right of the touchscreen. One of these to images is the same as the first displayed image. The second image is different. The dog should press the image which was displayed in the previous step to be rewarded.

### Sequential Learning

Three images are displayed on the screen. At the start they cannot be interacted with. They will one after the other be replaced by a different image in a random order. Once all images have been replaced the three original images will reappear after a short time. The dog now must press the images in the same order that they disappeared in. Should any of the images be pressed in the incorrect order the trial the images disappear for a short duration and the negative sound is played. Afterwards the same three images will reappear and disappears in the same order as before. This repeats until all images are pressed in the correct order.
